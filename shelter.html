							<h1>Plotting the Relationship between COVID-19 Cases and Shelter Occupancy in Toronto, ON, Canada</h1>
							<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/05/14/tents-housing-the-homeless-are-popping-up-around-toronto-heres-what-the-city-is-doing-about-it.html" target="_blank">tent encampments have been increasingly popping up</a> in the city. In the latter half of the year, a group <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-homeless-tents-shelters-pandemic-1.5746955" target="_blank">went before a Toronto court</a> to argue that they are safer in such encampents than in shelters provided by the city due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They were seeking to stop eviction orders being issued by the city to residents of encampments located in its public parks.</p>
                            <p>I wanted to visualize the relationship between shelter occupancy and daily reported cases in Toronto so I collected COVID and shelter data from <a href="https://open.toronto.ca/" target="_blank">Toronto's Open Data Portal</a>. For data wrangling I used Pandas and for visualization I used matplotlib.</p>
                            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Covid-and-Shelters.jpg" alt="" /></span>The first chart shows the daily proportion of total shelter capacity in the city that was filled for the years 2018 through 2020. I used the proportion of capacity filled as opposed to the raw occupancy numbers to account for shelters reducing their capacity in 2020 to comply with the province's COVID-19 restrictions. As you can see, shelter occupancy was relatively stable in 2018 and 2019 with shelters consistently being about 95% full. In April 2020 occupancy begins to plunge.</p>
                            <p>The second chart plots the number of daily reported COVID-19 cases in Toronto. I computed the Spearman correlation between the two variables for 2020, which shows a moderate negative correlation.</p>
